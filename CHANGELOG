CHANGELOG will be kept as a journal will the app is in a draft/POC state, until
a release appears.

Got the main pieces there:

- startproject, project_template: good
- AppInspector and TemplateCommand: good & tested
- commands, code templates: good & tested
- docs: probably good because they include settings used in Vagrant, but are
  worth refreshing. A refactor would be good in a couple of places where there
  are packs of 50 lines of code.
- stability: I still need to make sure it runs perfectly, so I plan to test
  startproject from within vagrant itself, nesting 2 vagrant boxes. It would
  like to automate this but it would be really nasty for travis-ci i think,
  bootstrapping a VM takes long time on my computer already so I don't see this
  happenning every 5 minutes on a public server, gotta be a good neighbour.
- fun: ain't nothing as fun !
